# SkaNet
My own implementations of networking in C99, this would have been a submission for [RayLib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) but there is a nice candidate for that so. Meh.

I will use this for a project down the road. This was not my plan for a initil release but, i need this for a CTF later so :sob:

This implementation is for educational purposes, and should not be used as anything other than that.

This project is free of any licence and obligations, however i or any other contributor shall never be liable for any issues incurred legal or otherwize by use of this code.

This code is to be considered unsafe for use in any network application, and is therefore used at your own risk.
